# Proactive-DIS-assessment

Proactively identify how a code/change/new feature impacts DIS along with the level of impact - can help decide if we can go ahead with the feature


Creating a system that proactively identifies how a code change or new feature impacts a Distributed Information System (DIS) and assesses the level of impact involves several components. While this use case is complex and tailoring it to a specific DIS might require in-depth customization, I'll provide an example using Python and the OpenAI API to demonstrate how you might approach generating assessments of code changes or new features.
